		<b>Why Reinvention‑1 Exists</b></br>
Space is no longer a distant frontier—it is a critical extension of modern digital infrastructure. Satellites now support communications, navigation, science, and global operations, yet the security models that protect systems on Earth have not always kept pace with the realities of orbit.
Reinvention‑1 was created to close that gap.</p><p>
The platform enables real‑world experimentation with:</br>

Secure satellite‑to‑ground communications</br>
Protected telemetry, logging, and mission data flows</br>
Cloud‑hosted data ingestion and transformation</br>
Controlled access to mission insights through a public‑facing portal</p><p>

All of this is designed to support learning, validation, and future space‑security capabilities—not theoretical models, but operational proof.
</p>
<p>
<b>Looking Forward</b></p><p>
Reinvention‑1 represents an early step in a much larger journey: bringing modern security, data, and cloud practices into the space domain.</p><p>
What we learn here informs what comes next—future missions, future architectures, and future ways of protecting systems that operate at planetary scale.</p><p>
Reinvention‑1 is how we test the future, safely—one orbit at a time.
